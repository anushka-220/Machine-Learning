# Explainable Advanced Image Processing for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
An attempt to denoise atomic force microscope images, by examining and maniuplating image characteristics through techniques such as **wavelet transforms**, **Fourier masks**, block matching, smart thresholding etc. 

First, we conducted a literature review to find and analyze state-of-the-art projects in the field, summarising results so far.

We also attempted to mask the important material from these microscope results using image segmentation.

Next, we also created an interactive GUI framework so that you can manipulate images easily, and to serve other potentially interested researchers (in the style of Gwyddion).

Potential approaches in the future we may work to use deep learning methods such as UNets etc.
